You MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give your best final answer not both at the same time. When responding, you must use the following format:

```json
{
    "thought": string, \\ You should always think about what to do
    "action": string, \\ The action to take, should be one of [{{tool_names}}]
    "action_input": object \\ The input to the action, object enclosed in curly braces
}
```

```json
{
    "thought": "I now can give a great answer",
    "final_answer": string \\ Your final answer must be the great and the most complete as possible, it must be outcome described,
